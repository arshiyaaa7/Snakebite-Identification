# 🐍 SnakeBite Identification

## 📑 Project Description
The SnakeBite Identification project is a machine learning-based application designed to identify whether a snakebite is from a venomous or non-venomous snake. This project leverages image processing and classification techniques to predict the type of snake using a trained model.

## 🌟 Features
- 🐍 Snakebite image classification
- 🧠 Machine Learning model for venomous/non-venomous prediction
- 🗃️ Dataset handling and preprocessing
- 📊 Visualization of predictions

## 💻 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📦 OpenCV for image processing
- 🤖 Scikit-learn for model training
- 💾 NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/snakebite-identification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snakebite-identification
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python SNAKEBITEFINAL.py
   ```
2. Provide an input image of the snakebite.
3. View the prediction result: venomous or non-venomous.
